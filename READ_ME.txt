                                                     ..................About the Portal...................

  1.The 'Brain Opener's E Learning Portal' has a dual level structure -         // self-sustained
     Teacher level and Student level

  2. Only authorised teachers can log in, create the study material and create or modify the question bank for quiz . //This ensures data security

  3. Similarly, a student can also create an account,
      view the study material and take a quiz on whichever 
      chapters he desires.  

  4. A special feature of the quiz is that the teacher
      can mark the difficulty level of a question as 'Easy', 'Medium' and 'Difficult' so that all the students get
      the same level of questions, though the questions being randomly selected.

                                                     ..................  Something more  ...................
